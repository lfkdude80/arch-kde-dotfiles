# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for lfkdude80's Linux setup.

## What's in here:

- `.zshrc` – main Zsh shell configuration
- `.p10k.zsh` – Powerlevel10k prompt theme config
- `~/.config/neofetch/config.conf` – Neofetch customization

## Purpose

This repo helps me store, track, and replicate my personal Linux configuration across systems or after fresh installs.

## How I use it

After a clean install, I clone this repo and restore configurations manually or via symlinks (coming soon).

More configs and notes to come.
